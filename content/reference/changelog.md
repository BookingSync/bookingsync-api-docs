## Work in progress

We're still in the process of building the API. While the technical parts
(authorization, JSON support etc.) are mostly done, not all resources
are complete or even available.

## 2015-01-08
  * [improvement] Add `title` to `amenities`, include more photo versions urls in `photos` endpoint and add dimensions for each photo version.

## 2015-01-06
  * [improvement] Add `accounts` endpoint.

## 2014-12-25
  * [improvement] Explain `availabilities` mapping parameters.

## 2014-12-24
  * [update] Rename `bookings_public_write` scope to `bookings_write_owned`.

## 2014-11-28

## 2014-11-13
  * [improvement] The API will now return a 403 response when the current token doesn't have
    the scopes necessary to perform requested action. Previously that would have been 401.
