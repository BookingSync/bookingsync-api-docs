# BookingSync API Docs

## Installation

Just run `bundle install`.

## Development

Running `bundle exec guard` will start a guard server that automatically
recompiles the page on changes. If you have LiveReload enabled in the
browser, it will be turned on too.

This works best with pow.

## Publishing

Make sure to be on the master branch and having pulled the latest changes, then run `bundle exec rake publish` from your local machine.

You will need to wait few minutes before the changes are live on the documentation side.
