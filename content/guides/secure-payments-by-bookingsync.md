## Preface

If you have an integration with BookingSync and you create bookings on your side according to the instant booking flow (i.e. a booking gets confirmed only when the credit card payment is executed successfully), you can use our Secure Payments By BookingSync flow for this purpose to handle the payments for the booking.

If you are interested and would like to learn more, please reach out to our [API support](https://apisupport.smily.com/). Please note that you will need to demonstrate PCI DSS compliance by providing us an appropriate Attestation of Compliance.
