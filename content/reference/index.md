## Accessing the API

The BookingSync API can be accessed over HTTPS with base URL at
`https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/`.

## JSON

All data is sent and received as JSON.

Regardless whether the response returns a single resource or a collection,
the body is expected to be in the following format:

~~~json
{
  "plural_resource_name": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "attribute_name": "attribute_value"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

## Example cURL requests

GET:

~~~
curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/rentals
~~~

POST:

~~~
curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json'
--data '{"rentals":[{"name":"Name"}]}' https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/rentals
~~~

PUT:

~~~
curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json'
--request PUT --data '{"rentals":[{"name":"New Name"}]}' https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/rentals/RENTAL_ID
~~~

DELETE:

~~~
curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' --request DELETE
https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/rentals/RENTAL_ID
~~~

## Request Options

### Pagination

Large collections are paginated, meaning the response will include only
a subset of resources and links to other pages.

The links are sent in the `Link` header, e.g.:

~~~
Link: <https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/accounts?page=1>; rel="first", <https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/accounts?page=2>; rel="next", <https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/accounts?page=3>; rel="last"
X-Total-Pages: 3
~~~

The possible `rel` values are:

Name  | Description
------|------------
next  | Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results.
last  | Shows the URL of the last page of results.
first | Shows the URL of the first page of results.
prev  | Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results.
{: class="table table-bordered"}

We've built in a default limit on results, you can use the `per_page` parameter to change how many results per page you want to get. Large queries can hurt performance, so `per_page` is capped by the default limit. If you wish to retrieve more records, you should make multiple requests using the `page` parameter and combine the results within your application.

### Limiting Fields

For retrieving collection of large resources, it is sometimes useful to limit
the attributes returned by the API. For example, if we wanted to get only the
`id` and `business_name` fields of the Accounts, we could specify that in the
request:

~~~
GET https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/accounts?fields=id,business_name
~~~

### Sideloading Associations

For lowering the number of requests, it is sometimes useful to sideload associations.
For example, if we wanted to sideload availabilities of the Rentals, we could specify
that in the request:

~~~
GET https://www.bookingsync.com/api/v3/rentals?include=availability
~~~

## HTTPS

Every request to the API must use HTTPS. When the API is accessed over HTTP,
a `302` redirect will be returned with the correct HTTPS url.

## Rate limiting

Each application accessing the API has a limit of 1000 requests per hour.

Rate limiting information will be returned in the headers:

~~~
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1395140400
~~~

`X-RateLimit-Reset` is the UNIX time at which the next limit reset happens.

_Note_: Reaching the rate limit, will return an error message `API v3 rate limit exceeded.` with `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
