All resources containing personal data have two special attributes corresponding to the **EU G(eneral)D(ata)P(rotection)R(egulation)**:

- processing_restricted_at - a timestamp representing the time when an individual requests the restriction of processing of their personal data (“Right to restrict processing “)

- forget_me_at - a timestamp representing the time when an individual asks for erasure of their data (“Right to erasure”). When this timestamp is set, all the personal data on a given resource must also be anonymized.

As a BookingSync Partner, it is your legal obligation to process these attributes correctly in accordance with **GDPR**.
